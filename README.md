# simple_form_in_php
This is a simple form created in php that takes entries as input, stores them in the database and shows them to the user.
1. Create a database named sampledb and create a table named students in that.
2. Install a xampp server and start apache server and mysql database.
3. Search for htdocs in the xampp folder of c drive(where you have installed xampp):
     Create a folder in htdocs and put all these files there.
5. If xampp does not work stop the mysql service from services in windows(this problem occurs when you have already installed the mysql in your windows as the mysql service allocates the port 3306)
6. Now click on admin in mysql of xampp to see if entries are stored in the database.
7. Now to try this form, go in the browser search bar and write
   localhost:/foldername/
